This is a simple landing page for fictional store.

You can see it here:

I made it to practice my coding skills.

I use HTML, CSS and and a little bit of JS.

I code it from scratch, without any framework.
(but I use Smooth Scroll plugin)

During this project I practice with flexbox and mobile first concept.

I tried to follow the SMACSS rules.

I use JADE and SASS.

I use GRUNT.
